'''WAP to find simple interest for given principal amount. Take input of principal amount,
rate of interest and year from user. (Interest=(PRN)/100) â€“ self study'''

# taking input from user
principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
rate = float(input("Enter the rate of interest: "))
time = float(input("Enter the time period (in years): "))

# calculating simple interest
interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100

# printing the result
print(f"The simple interest for principal amount {principal}, rate of interest {rate}, and time period {time} years is {interest}.")
