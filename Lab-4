'''WAP to find power and square root of given number without using inbuilt function. 
(note: find power using ** operator and square root using 0.5 value)'''

# taking input from user
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# finding power of number
power = num ** 2
print(f"The power of {num} is {power}")

# finding square root of number
sqrt = num ** 0.5
print(f"The square root of {num} is {sqrt}")
